# hello-world
hello world assignment for Ivy Tech INFM109
The assignment said to write a bit about myself. I'm not entirely sure what to write honestly, but I will say I am enjoying this class so far. I'm really glad I could remember my old github login info so I didn't have to make a new account lol.
